Executables, in ${prefix}/bin:

  turtle        A standalone compiler for Turtle.  Type 
                `turtle --help' to get an overview of the available
		command line options.


Libraries, in ${prefix}/lib.  Depending on the platform and options
given to configure, you may get shared libraries in addition or
instead of these static libraries:

  libturtle.a   An object library containing the Turtle compiler,
	        You can use Turtle in your own programs by linking 
                against this.

  libturtle.la  libtool archive of the above.

  liburtle.so,
  libturtle.so.0,
  libturtle.so.0.0.0    
                Shared library version of the above.

  libturtlert.a This object library contains the Turtle runtime 
                system.  It is linked against programs created by
                the Turtle compiler.

  libturtlert.la
                libtool archive of the above.

  libturtlert.so,
  libturtlert.so.0,
  libturtlert.so.0.0.0
                Shared library version of the runtime system.
