* General

** `Interval' types

Include the notion of `interval' types, that is, integer and real
types for which the lower and upper limits can be specified.

Example:

type day = [1, 31];
type month = [1, 12]
type weekday = [1, 7];


* Documentation

** The grammar in turtle.texi is now authorative

Update grammars in turtle-def.tex and da.tex.  Make sure turtle.texi
is always consistent with the parser and the comments in parser.c.

** array <expr> of <expr>

Make clear whether the second expression can be omitted, and if not,
correct the documentation.


** Overloading

Document the overloading of functions.


* Implementation

** Remove `any'

This type is too strange, poorly supported and has strange semantics.
If we really want something like this, we should implement proper
polymorphism.
