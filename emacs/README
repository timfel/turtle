Turtle mode for GNU Emacs, version 1.0
--------------------------------------

This package provides support for the programming language Turtle.

Copy the Emacs lisp file `turtle-mode.el' in this directory either to
a private direcory or to the site-lisp directory and setup your
load-path in your .emacs file accordingly. E.g. if you would copy the
emacs file to /home/user/emacs you would have to add:

  (setq load-path (cons "/home/user/emacs" load-path))

Finally, make sure you put:

  (require 'turtle-mode)

in your .emacs file. That's it!

Note: this mode has only been tested with GNU Emacs so far, please
report success or failure report about using it with XEmacs to
<mgrabmue@cs.tu-berlin.de>.  Thank you.
