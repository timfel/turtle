This directory contains the compiler library for Turtle and the
runtime library for Turtle programs.

To build the libraries, do `make' in the current directory.  If you
want the complete compiler (and most certainly you will), do `make' in
the parent directory.  This will build the compiler in `../turtle'
which uses the compiler library to compile programs from the command
line.


Files in this directory:
------------------------

libturtlert.c   Runtime library for Turtle programs.
libturtlert.h   Declarations for the runtime library..

*.h, *.c        Various source files for the compiler library.
