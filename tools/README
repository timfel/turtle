This directory holds some utility programs, mostly useful for Turtle
developers.

`make turtledoc' builds an experimental Turtle documentation
extractor, but currently it is not doing more than lexing a Turtle
file.  Note that the scanner and parser are not up-to-date to the
latest changes in the Turtle grammar.
